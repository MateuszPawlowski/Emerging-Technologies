    "### Introduction\n",
    "[1] In a mathematical form, a square root is a number equal to a number that is squared by itself. For example: $ y^2 = x $. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The symbol $ \\sqrt{} $ will always mean the positive square root.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Example: $ \\sqrt{64} = 8 $ thats beacause $ 8^2 = 64 $\n",
    "\n",
    "We can calculate the square root of a number using Newton's method [1,2].\n",
    "To find the square root $z$ number $x$, we can iterate using the following equation.\n",
    "$$ z = y + (\\frac xy) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### My way of getting the answer\n",
    "With a quick google search I was able to find some good square root function however all of the functions were outputting around 50 digits after the decimal and after that it would just show me zeros. That was no good to me as our task stated we needed the first hundred numbers after the decimal. This made the task much harder to figure out and gave me a challenge. After some resaearch I found a forum on stackoverflow [4], explaining and showing a way of generating x amount of digits. This would store the information in a string. Now after that I have the numbers itself and they are fairly accurate to the original i needed to add a decimal after the first digit. That is when I started looking around the internet again and found another forum on stackoverflow explaining and showing how to go about it [5].\n",

    "### Introduction\n",
    "A Chi Squared test also known as $ x^2 $ test is a statistical hypothesis test. It is a test to see is there a significant relationship between two categorical variables (wheter the varaibles are independent or related). This test can not compare any continuous variables or categorical and continuous  variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are not calculating one thing with the whole test. Matter of fact it is 4 different tests we are going to perform. The degrees of freedom, expected frequencies, test statistics and the p-value.\n",
    "Here are the formulas for each one:\n",
    "\n",
    "[2]\n",
    "**Degrees of freedom:** $DF = (r - 1) * (c - 1)$ where $r$ is the number of level for one categorical variable and $c$ is the number of levels for the other categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "[2]\n",
    "**Expected frequencies:** $E_r,_c = \\frac{n_r*n_c}{n}$ (to see it better: $E_r,_c = n_r*n_c / n$) where $E_r,_c$ is the expected frequency count for level $r$ of variable $A$ and level $c$ of variable $B$. $N_r$ is the total number of sample observations at level $r$ of variable $A$. $N_c$ is the total number of sample observations at level $c$ of Variable $B$. $n$ is the total sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "[2]\n",
    "**Test Statistic:** $x^2 = \\Sigma [\\frac{(O_r,_c - E_r,_c)^2}{E_r,_c}]$ (to see it better: $x^2 = \\Sigma [(O_r,_c - E_r,_c)^2 / E_r,_c])$ where $O_r,_c$ is the observed frequency count at level $r$ of Variable $A$ and level $c$ of Variable $B$, and $E_r,_c$ is the expected frequency count at level $r$ of Variable $A$ and level $c$ of Variable $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "[2]\n",
    "**P Value:** The P-value is the probability of observing a sample statistic as extreme as the test statistic. Since the test statistic is a chi-square, use the Chi-Square Distribution Calculator to assess the probability associated with the test statistic. Use the degrees of freedom computed above.\n",
